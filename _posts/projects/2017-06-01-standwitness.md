<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geZu9fwnVuI" target="_blank">Stand Witness</a> campaign, this series of portraits celebrated the fans for their support throughout the 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>These pieces were initially shared on social media, and were eventually printed out for giveaways and resized for wallpapers and lockscreens.</p>
